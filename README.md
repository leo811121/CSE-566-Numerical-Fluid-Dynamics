# Course Overview
## OBJECTIVES
- A thorough understanding of the fundamentals - the basis for choosing and evaluating numerical methods
- The ability to critically interpret numerical methods as presented in the literature. We will work through several papers and examine their descriptions of their methods and how they are assessed in terms of stability, accuracy, and error characteristics
- Most important: the ability to apply these methods to high-performance computers. There will be no "black boxes" (other than visualization packages) in the course - the emphasis is on coding and understanding numerical method behavior as applied to linear and nonlinear fluid flow problems in 1-D, 2-D and ultimately 3-D settings.
- Consequence of the above: That by the end of the course you are very comfortable with, and capable of effectively using, supercomputer-class facilities. This includes writing and debugging code, compiling and running it, and visualizing your results. Along these lines, you will use the "old, slow" way of coding problems, along with newer development environments (IDEs) that are the future.

## Topics
Our goal is solving fluid flow problems.  In so doing you need awareness of three areas of study: (1) fluid dynamics and kinematics; (2) programming, data interrogation, and visualization, and (3) the numerical methods that tie the first two areas together.   We will discuss, and cover material on, some of all three areas, including the following.

### Fluid 
- Fluids: Concepts
- Flow kinematics
- Fluid flow equations
- Dimensions, units
- Compressibility
- Stability vs. shear
- Simplifications, scaling
- Some classic solutions

### Coding, data, visualization	
- Coding: old vs. new; IDEs
- Languages, compilers
- Precision and accuracy
- (Super)computers, XSEDE
- Data and the 4th paradigm
- Visualization: idioms, tools
- Debugging efficiently
- Code optimization basics

### Numerical methods
- Classes of solution methods
- Multi-dimensional problems
- Boundary conditions, symmetry
- Nonlinear PDEs are fun
- Theory vs. practice:Â  Stability
- Systems of equations
- Handling discontinuities
- Initialization; Intro. to data assimilation
